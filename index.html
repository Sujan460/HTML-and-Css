Make-Up Art Cosmetics started life in Toronto, Canada. Makeup artist and photographer Frank Toskan and salon owner Frank Angelo became frustrated by the lack of makeup that photographed well, so they decided to create their own. At first, they made the cosmetics in their kitchen and sold them straight from the salon to fellow makeup artists, as well as models and photographers. Soon, stylists and fashion editors got in on the action. As the magazine credits racked up and word-of-mouth popularity grew, the duo launched M·A·C in March 1984 from a counter in a Toronto department store.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The personal care & skincare brand Dove is the flagship brand of the FMCG giant Unilever. It was introduced by the MNC in the year 1957 & initially the products were launched for women later on the brand has extended its product lines by making products available for Men and Baby segment.
            The brand launched its “Campaign for Real Beauty” in an effort to widen the definition of beauty after studies conducted by Dove proved that “the definition of beauty had become limiting and unattainable” (Dove.com) and findings concluded that “only 2% of women around the world would describe themselves as beautiful”.
            The Dove brand of personal care products currently includes everything from shampoos to deodorants to facial washes. For the purposes of this assignment, I will focus on advertisements for the Dove Beauty Bar, the original product of Dove which has been around since 1957. The brand has a strong focus on “purity, moisture, cleanliness, natural beauty, and touchable skin” (Elani). The brand promises softness and improvement of the skin and advertises confidence as the consumer benefit (Dove.com).
